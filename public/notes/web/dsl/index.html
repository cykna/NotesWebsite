[[Protocol|Protocols]] just make a way to both Ends to understand that data. For example, a request, in terms of web, is a content sent normally via [[TCP]] using the [[HTTP]] protocol where both Ends will understand. But the way that data is sent on the physical world is a bit different.
Keeping in mind a request from the web, when made, it&rsquo;s content is transformed to Radio electromagnetic waves, then the router from the [[ISP]] receives it, decode and sends to the [[ISP]] central office via cable, it depends on the way the ISP will make so, but let&rsquo;s now suppose it&rsquo;s with copper cables. This is called then DSL. When working with it, the router will decode the content sent from the device, maybe via [[Wifi]], then depending on the kind of data it&rsquo;s, it will be sent in a determined frequency. When working with talking, because the ISP can be the provider of telephones as well, the data sent will be around 0 to 4khz, when uploading, it will be sent around 4khz to 50khz, and above that, is treated as download content, normally between 50khz to 1mhz">
